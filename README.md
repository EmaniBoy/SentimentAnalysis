Project Description: 
Sentiment Analyzer is a Java-based application that performs sentiment analysis on textual data using Apache OpenNLP's machine learning models. This tool takes textual input (such as customer reviews) and determines the sentiment polarity (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). The application leverages pre-trained NLP models for text classification and tokenization to provide accurate sentiment analysis.

Features: 
Load and analyze textual data from JSON files.
Utilize Apache OpenNLP's pre-trained models for sentiment classification.
Process text efficiently using tokenization and document categorization.
Generate sentiment insights with structured output.
